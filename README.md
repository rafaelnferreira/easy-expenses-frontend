## Easy expenses - Front end

Motivation and what this project is:

I love to maintain spreadsheets for personal/work related expenses, I've tried many apps and there are many great apps out there, but I was never able to use them for more than one week (maybe it is just me); 

Spreadsheets are great by themselves, but a needed an easier way to input data.

I wanted to get my hands dirty on React and AWS Lambda

## Dev environment setup

1. You need Node, React and Yarn.
2. You need the [back end](https://github.com/rafaelnferreira/easy-expenses-backend) project up and running so you can submit requests.
3. You need a valid API credential (Web) created from [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis) and set as a environment variable in your system as 'REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID'.
4. Clone the repo and simple trigger:

```
yarn install
yarn start-dev
```
